ASSIGNMENT3B:

Mehmet:

With this assignment I have done many things.

I set up the BCYCLE_PKG3B so that we could begin with the assignment for each of the procedures.

First of all I did my assignments that we, as a group gave to each group members to finish.

I had responsibility for the more advanced ones so I can teach to the other group members and commented these.
    - The ones I had the responsibility for was BICYCLE_SUMMARY_PP and BICYCLE_SUMMARY_PP

After this I coded all the procedures by myself in my own SQL files to be able to learn from them and 
be more experienced in PL/SQL.
    This made me:
        - More comfortable by working with PL/SQL.
        - Learn all of the assignments and find out how to solve these.
        - Help the other group members when they had problems with their given procedures.
        - Come up with different ideas on how to solve the assignments.

When the deadline came close I made sure things were structured and pointed out things we need to do to the group members
so it looks nice and structured. I also made sure we had SQL files for each procedure. I also made sure we used same local variable names etc. so it isnt different names in each procedure.


Questions to the teacher and teacher assistants:
We have commented out the parameter p_end_time in PURCHASE_MEMBERSHIP_PP
    - This is because we made the sophisticated version. We have commented out parts of the code where we think it is not relevant anymore because it is sophisticated, but if it wasnt we would uncomment these parts.

In REMOVE_BICYCLE_PP where we use the procedure UPDATE_BICYCLE_STATUS_PP we have given NULL values on the 'range' and 'power' parameters because the bicycle is getting removed. Therefore we thought since it is getting removed there are no use case by getting the last values for either 'power' and 'range' parameters in there. But if this is needed, please tell us so we can put it in our code before the final assignment.

In END_TRIP_PP we as a group think that p_station_id must not be null. Because if the station_id is null there would be no possible way to know which station the given bicycle id is on. In the assignment it doesnt say that p_station_id has to be null. We havent made it on the p_dock_id here, but we think that it must not be null. We would appreciate it if you guys could give a feedback on this. We did not get any in the previous assignment.
